# Goals
1. Appreciate how backprop works at the implementation level
2. Use this as an excuse to use and compare OpenCL and CUDA 
3. Learn how to setup differentiated compilation (plain, OpenCL, CUDA)

# TODO
- [x] Basic backprop (add, mul) with singular float values
- [ ] Vector(tensor?) enabled backprop using OpenCL
- [ ] Vector(tensor?) enabled backprop using CUDA
